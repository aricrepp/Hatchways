Hatchways Front End Assessment

## About

This is the Front End Coding Challenge from Hatchways. I managed to build this in one afternoon while juggling full time work, a baby, and night software development school. The content was built to the design specifications of the Hatchway assessment. Some choices were decisions for ease of implementation and speed.
